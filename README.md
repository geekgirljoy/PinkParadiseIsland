* #### If you can't rotate the camera/player: 
    Try **double clicking** the unity web player. This has something to do with the browser "taking control" of the mouse and it's like a "security feature" or something so... there's not      much I can do about it other than to advise you to double click the player if that happens. 


## Windows
WIndows users have a choice between a 32 bit and 64 bit version, If you computer is new you will probably prefer the 64 bit version otherwise, eh... try one and if it doesn't work try the other, it's not rocket science!

Run the **Pink Paradise Island.exe** file.

## MacOS
Mac users can run the MacOS.app file to um... install?? the app? I'm sorry it's been a long time since I've used a Mac but if anyone cares to write me notes on the experience I will include them here with credit to the source.

## Linux
